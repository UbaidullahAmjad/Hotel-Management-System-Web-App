# Introduction:

Clients have already built systems for their hotel business but it was not a complete software platform that can compete with competitors in the market. If your system lack performance and design then it means you do have not any presence in the market.
So considering all these issues in mind client contacted me for the development of online platforms that are capable enough to meet the stakeholder's requirements and should have the capability to compete with competitors.
I take this project as a challenge although I have a lot of experience in the development of such vast enterprise-level projects.
I accepted this and prove it as an excellent experience for me from the client's point of view because this system not only includes every business logic but also has the capability to compete with the industry from a performance and design perspective.
